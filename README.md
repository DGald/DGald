👋 Hi, I’m Danilo Galdámez (DGald)
👀 I’m interested in Automation and Robotics Engineering, and the application of emerging technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning and taking on new challenges, which has allowed me to adapt to various situations, whether working autonomously or in a team.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robotics projects and the implementation of software and hardware solutions.
📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile or mi Emial Danilogales98@gmail.com
Despite being a student, I already have practical experience in robotics projects and have participated in several competitions. 
This has strengthened my ability to work under pressure and in team environments. Also, in my position at Cinépolis, I work in the IT department, where I can apply and expand my technical skills.
